"""Over-generation (class-cap) guard tests for
``agents.agent_owl_generator.engine``.

Regression coverage for the scenario-1 auto-map timeout: the generator emitted
a 110-class ontology (one class per column/value) which ballooned downstream
auto-mapping (~5 classes/chunk with cool-downs → ~22 chunks) past the scenario
budget. The guard asks the model — bounded — to consolidate to the core
entities before accepting.

``call_chat_completion`` is patched to return scripted Turtle answers so the
guard runs without a live endpoint. The pitfall/quality loop is disabled via
``options={"generation_max_iterations": 0, "owl_eval_max_rounds": 0}`` to isolate the class-cap guard.
