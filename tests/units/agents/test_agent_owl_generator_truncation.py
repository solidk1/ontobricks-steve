"""Truncation-guard tests for ``agents.agent_owl_generator.engine``.

Regression coverage for the scenario-1 failure where the OWL generator
accepted a length-truncated LLM response as the final ontology: the cut-off
Turtle failed to parse in every RDF syntax downstream and landed an empty
ontology (0 classes), which the generation wizard polled on until timeout.

``call_chat_completion`` is patched to return scripted responses carrying a
``finish_reason`` so we can drive the guard without a live endpoint. The
generation-quality (pitfall) loop is disabled via
``options={"generation_max_iterations": 0, "owl_eval_max_rounds": 0}`` so a
complete Turtle answer is accepted directly without the pitfall or PGE loops.
