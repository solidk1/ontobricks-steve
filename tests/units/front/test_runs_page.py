"""Knowledge Graph → Management → Runs renders two independent tables.

Build runs and analytics runs share no columns, so they live in one tab each
rather than being merged into a single timeline. Each tab owns its loading /
empty / error elements: a failure fetching one must not blank the other.

Most assertions drive a ``TestClient`` and parse the RENDERED HTML (via the
``_html`` / ``_tags`` / ``_find`` helpers from ``test_ui_rendering.py``),
which proves the partial is actually included and rendered on ``/dtwin/``.
A few assertions fall back to reading a template file directly off disk —
only where the rendered page genuinely cannot express the fact: e.g. that
the analytics modal lives in ``dtwin.html`` (not merged into the partial's
output by inclusion) or that an id is absent from one specific source file.
