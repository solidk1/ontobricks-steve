"""Contract: the Data Quality rule popup only offers the target entity's properties.

Both the property select and the condition rows resolve ownership through one
helper. A property belongs to an entity when its `domain` names that entity (as
a name or a URI) or when the entity inherits it from a parent. A property with
no declared domain belongs to no entity and must not be offered under all of
them, which is what the previous `|| !dom` filter did.
