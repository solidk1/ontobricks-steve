# OntoBricks User Guide

## Introduction

OntoBricks is a visual tool for designing ontologies, mapping them to Databricks tables, generating R2RML mappings, synchronizing data to a triple store, and exploring your graph viewer visually. This guide walks you through the complete workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Access to a Databricks workspace
- Personal access token from Databricks
- SQL Warehouse ID
- Catalog and schema with tables to map

## Application Workflow

OntoBricks follows a 3-step workflow:

```
1. Design Ontology → 2. Assign Data Sources → 3. Knowledge Graph (Sync & Explore)
```

---

## Step 1: Design Ontology

Navigate to the **Ontology** page by clicking "Ontology" in the navigation bar.

### Option A: Visual Designer (Recommended)

Click **Business Views** in the sidebar to use the visual drag-and-drop interface.

#### Creating Entities

1. Click the **+ Add Entity** button in the toolbar
2. A new entity box appears on the canvas
3. **Edit the entity name** by clicking on it
4. **Add attributes** using the + button on the entity
5. **Move entities** by dragging them around the canvas

#### Customizing Entities

Each entity supports:
- **Icon**: Click the icon button (🎨) to select an emoji
- **Auto-Map Icons**: In the **Model** view, click the smiley face button (😊) in the toolbar to automatically assign emoji icons to all entities that still have the default icon. This feature uses the configured LLM to pick the most appropriate emoji for each entity name.
- **Description**: Click the description button (📝) to add notes
- **Attributes**: Add data properties directly on the entity

#### Creating Relationships

1. Click and drag from one entity's connector (○) to another
2. A relationship line is created between them
3. **Edit the relationship name** by clicking on the label
4. **Add relationship attributes** using the + button on the relationship

#### Creating Inheritance Links

Inheritance links represent class hierarchies (rdfs:subClassOf):

1. Click the **△ (Inheritance)** button in the toolbar to activate inheritance mode
2. **Drag from a parent entity's connector** to a child entity
3. A dotted line with a hollow arrow appears from parent to child
4. **Child entities automatically inherit** all attributes from the parent (displayed as read-only)
5. Click the inheritance arrow to **reverse the direction** if needed

**Example**: Create an "Employee" entity that inherits from "Person":
- Person has attributes: name, email
- Employee inherits name and email from Person, plus its own attributes: employeeId, salary

#### Relationship Direction

Each relationship has a direction button showing:
- **→** Forward: From source to target entity
- **←** Reverse: From target to source entity
- **↔** Bidirectional: Both directions

Click the direction indicator to cycle through options.

#### Canvas Controls

- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or zoom buttons
- **Pan**: Click and drag the background
- **Auto Layout**: Click the grid icon to organize entities
- **Center**: Click the center button to fit all entities in view
- **Minimap**: Toggle the minimap for navigation

#### Auto-Save

All changes in the Design view are automatically saved. You'll see a brief "Saving..." indicator when changes are persisted.

### Option B: Form-Based Interface

#### Configure Basic Information

1. Click **Information** in the sidebar
2. Enter an **Ontology Name** (e.g., "MyOrganization")
   - Used in the URI and file naming
3. The **Base URI** is auto-generated from:
   - The Default Base URI Domain (from Settings)
   - The domain name
   - Format: `{domain}/{DomainName}#`
   - Example: `https://databricks-ontology.com/MyOrganization#`
   - Toggle the **Custom** switch on the Domain page to enter a custom URI

#### Add Classes (Entities)

1. Click **Entities** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Class** button
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: Class identifier (e.g., "Person", "Department")
   - **Label**: Human-readable name (optional)
   - **Icon**: Select an emoji/icon for visualization
   - **Description**: Brief description of the entity
4. **Add Attributes**: Use the attributes section to add data properties
5. Click **Apply** to write the class into the session

**Example Classes:**
- 👤 Person (represents people in your organization)
- 🏢 Department (organizational units)
- 📋 Project (work projects)

#### Add Relationships (Object Properties)

1. Click **Relationships** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Property** button
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: Relationship identifier (e.g., "worksIn", "manages")
   - **Domain**: Select source entity from dropdown
   - **Range**: Select target entity from dropdown
   - **Direction**: Choose Forward, Reverse, or Bidirectional
4. **Add Attributes**: Add relationship properties if needed
5. Click **Apply** to write the relationship into the session

**Example Relationships:**
- worksIn (Person → Department)
- manages (Person → Project)
- collaboratesWith (Person ↔ Person)

### Advanced Features

OntoBricks provides advanced ontology features under the **Advanced** section in the sidebar.

#### SWRL Rules (Graphical Editor)

Click **Business Rules** in the sidebar to define inference rules using SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language). OntoBricks provides a **graphical D3-based editor** for building rules visually.

1. Click **Add Rule** to open the fullscreen rule editor
2. The editor has two panes:
   - **Left**: Interactive D3 graph showing your ontology classes and relationships
   - **Right**: Rule builder with **IF** (antecedent) and **THEN** (consequent) atom lists
3. **Building rules visually**:
   - Right-click a class or relationship on the graph to open the context menu
   - Choose **Add to IF** or **Add to THEN** to add atoms
   - Variable names (e.g., `?x`, `?y`) are assigned automatically
   - The SWRL preview updates live as you add atoms
4. **Advanced mode**: Toggle the Advanced section to edit raw antecedent/consequent text directly
5. Enter a **Rule Name** and optional **Description**
6. Click **Save Rule**

**Import/Export**: Click the header **SWRL** button to open a modal
(same pattern as Data Quality → SHACL). Refresh shows the current rules as
OntoBricks SWRL text (`# Rule:` / optional `# Description:` /
`antecedent -> consequent`). Export downloads a `.swrl` file; Import appends
parsed rules to the existing list (duplicate names are allowed).

**Example SWRL Rules:**

```
Rule: InferGrandparent
Antecedent: Person(?x) ∧ hasParent(?x, ?y) ∧ hasParent(?y, ?z)
Consequent: hasGrandparent(?x, ?z)

Rule: InferManager
Antecedent: Person(?x) ∧ worksIn(?x, ?d) ∧ manages(?y, ?d)
Consequent: hasManager(?x, ?y)
```

Rules are compiled to **Spark/Postgres SQL** for execution in the Reasoning pipeline. The capability flags on `GraphDBBackend` reserve a slot for a future Cypher / Gremlin engine.

#### Expressions & Axioms

Click **Expr. & Axioms** in the sidebar to define OWL class expressions and axioms.

1. Click **Add Axiom** button
2. Select **Axiom Type**:
   - **Class Relationships**: Equivalent, Disjoint, Union, Intersection
   - **Property Relationships**: Inverse, Property Chain, Disjoint Properties
3. Configure subject, objects, and type-specific options
4. Click **Save Axiom**

**Example Axioms:**

| Type | Subject | Objects |
|------|---------|---------|
| Equivalent Classes | Employee | Person, hasJob |
| Disjoint With | Person | Organization |
| Union Of | Contact | Person, Company |
| Inverse Of | isParentOf | hasParent |
| Property Chain | hasGrandparent | hasParent, hasParent |

#### Data Quality (SHACL Shapes)

Click **Data Quality** in the sidebar to define data quality rules using W3C SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language).

1. Click **Add Shape** to create a new data quality shape
2. Select a **Category**:

| Category | Purpose | Example Constraints |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Completeness** | Required fields exist | `sh:minCount 1` — every entity must have a label |
| **Cardinality** | Correct number of values | `sh:maxCount 3` — at most 3 phone numbers |
| **Uniqueness** | Values are unique | `sh:hasValue` — specific value required |
| **Consistency** | Type-correct references | `sh:class` — target must be of correct type |
| **Conformance** | Format compliance | `sh:pattern` — email must match regex; `sh:minInclusive` / `sh:maxInclusive` — monthly fee between 1 and 10; `sh:minLength` / `sh:maxLength` — code is 3 to 8 characters |
| **Structural** | Graph structure rules | `sh:closed` — no unexpected properties |

3. Select the **Target Class** and **Property** to constrain
4. Choose the **SHACL Constraint Type** (minCount, maxCount, pattern, datatype, class, hasValue, etc.)
5. Configure constraint-specific parameters
6. Optionally add **conditions** (conformance and consistency rules only) — see below
7. Set **Severity** (Violation, Warning, Info) and an optional **Message**
8. Click **Save**

**Conditional rules (the IF block)**: a conformance or consistency rule can be
guarded so it only applies to the instances matching a set of conditions —
*IF `status` = active AND `amount` > 1000, THEN `email` must match the pattern*.
Each condition is a property, an operator and a value, built the same way as a
decision-table condition in Business Rules. The **All / Any** toggle combines
the rows with AND or OR. Conditions may reference any attribute of the target
entity, or a relationship with the `exists` / `does not exist` operators. A rule
with no conditions applies to every instance, exactly as before.

**Import/Export**: Shapes can be exported as W3C-compliant SHACL Turtle and imported from existing SHACL files. A guarded rule is exported as its own node shape with a SHACL-AF `sh:target [ a sh:SPARQLTarget ]`. Conditions are not reconstructed on import: the constraint comes back unguarded and the import result reports how many rules lost their conditions.

**Validation**: Shapes are executed in the Knowledge Graph → Data Quality section. Every check is compiled to SQL and run against the triple-store VIEW, which the build creates whatever graph engine the domain uses, so a rule gives the same answer on Lakebase, Delta and Neo4j domains. The VIEW carries the triples mapped from your source tables; triples added by reasoning live in the graph store and are deliberately outside the scope of data quality. A numeric-range rule also reports a value that is not a number at all, since SHACL treats a value it cannot compare as a violation. A rule that cannot be compiled to SQL is listed with an info icon and no pass rate rather than counted as passing.

### Dashboard Mapping

You can assign Databricks dashboards to entity types for embedded visualization in the Knowledge Graph:

1. Go to **Ontology** → **Entities**
2. Select an entity type (e.g., Customer, Meter)
3. In the entity details panel, find the **Dashboard** section
4. Click **Assign** to open the dashboard picker
5. Select a dashboard from your Databricks workspace
6. If the dashboard has parameters, map them to entity attributes:
   - **Entity ID**: Maps the parameter to the entity's unique identifier
   - **Attribute Name**: Maps the parameter to a specific entity attribute
7. Click **Apply** (writes into the session; publish the domain to persist)

**Parameter Mapping:**
When a dashboard has filter parameters (e.g., customer_id, meter_id), you can map them to:
- `__ID__`: The entity's unique identifier (extracted from URI)
- Any attribute defined on the entity type

When viewing an entity in the Knowledge Graph visualization, the dashboard will be embedded with the correct parameter values.

### Class Actions (Unity Catalog functions)

Beyond the linked dataset, an entity type can expose **actions** — Unity Catalog
functions that operate on a single entity and can be run from the Graph Explorer
or from an MCP client.

1. Go to **Ontology** → **Entities** and select an entity type
2. Open the **External** tab and find the **Actions** section
3. Click **Add** to open the function picker, then choose a catalog and schema
4. Pick a function and type a **description** — the description is what the LLM
   and the end user see, so make it explicit about what the action does
5. Click **Apply** (writes into the session; publish the domain to persist)

> **One-parameter contract**: the selected Unity Catalog function must accept
> **exactly one parameter — the ID of the entity to act on**. OntoBricks passes
> the entity's local ID (extracted from its URI) automatically at invocation
> time. Functions with a different number of parameters are shown greyed out in
> the picker and cannot be selected.

Table-valued functions (`RETURNS TABLE`) are executed as
`SELECT * FROM fn('<id>')` and their rows are rendered as a table; scalar
functions are executed as `SELECT fn('<id>') AS result` and their value is shown
as a single result.

In the Graph Explorer, actions appear both in the entity details panel and in
the node right-click menu. Only functions declared on the entity's ontology
class can be invoked — the server rejects anything else, so the ontology acts as
the allow-list.

### Option C: AI-Powered Wizard

Click **Generate** in the sidebar to generate an ontology automatically from your database schema using an LLM.

1. Select the **Model** (from those the deployment declares in `ONTOBRICKS_LLM_MODELS`)
2. Choose which **catalog/schema** metadata to include
3. (Optional) Select uploaded **Documents** to enrich the generation
4. Write custom **Guidelines** or pick a **Quick Template**
5. Click **Generate** to create the ontology

#### Documents (PDF and other formats)

Documents uploaded under **Domain → Documents** feed the Wizard. Plain-text
files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.xml`) are read directly. Binary
documents (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, images) are automatically converted to
markdown using the Databricks `ai_parse_document` function, which runs on your
configured **SQL warehouse** — so a warehouse must be configured and its
identity must have read access to the documents volume. Without a SQL warehouse,
binary documents are skipped and generation uses metadata, guidelines, and text
documents only.

#### Quick Templates

The Wizard provides predefined guideline templates for common domains (CRM, E-Commerce, IoT, Healthcare, Energy, etc.). Click a template button to pre-fill the guidelines textarea.

Templates are defined in `src/shared/config/constants.py` under `WIZARD_TEMPLATES` and served to the frontend via the `GET /ontology/wizard/templates` endpoint. To add a new template, add an entry to the dictionary:

```python
WIZARD_TEMPLATES = {
    "my_domain": {
        "label": "My Domain",
        "icon": "star",            # Bootstrap Icons name (without "bi-")
        "guidelines": "Generate an ontology for ...",
    },
    # ... existing templates
}
```

The button will appear automatically in the Wizard UI — no HTML changes needed.

### Option D: Import Industry-Standard Ontologies

Click **Import** in the sidebar to load ontologies from files or industry standards:

- **OWL**: Import an OWL file from your local machine or Unity Catalog
- **RDFS**: Import an RDFS schema file
- **FIBO**: Import the Financial Industry Business Ontology (EDM Council) — select domains such as Foundations, Business Entities, Securities, etc.
- **CDISC**: Import Clinical Data Interchange Standards (PhUSE) — select SDTM, CDASH, SEND, or ADaM modules
- **IOF**: Import the Industrial Ontologies Foundry (OAGi) — select Core, Maintenance, or Supply Chain domains for digital manufacturing ontologies

Industry-standard modules are fetched directly from their official servers/repositories and merged automatically. The Core/Foundation module is always included when selecting domain-specific modules.

### Preview OWL Output

Click **OWL** in the sidebar to see the generated OWL in Turtle format.

### Save Your Ontology

- **Validate**: Click to check for issues
- **Save**: Store to Unity Catalog Volume
- **Load**: Load an existing ontology from UC

---

## Step 2: Map Data Sources (Mapping)

Navigate to the **Mapping** page by clicking "Mapping" in the navigation bar.

> **Note**: You must have an ontology loaded before creating mappings. The "Ontology" indicator in the navbar should show a green checkmark.

### Information (Sidebar)

Click **Information** in the sidebar to view the current mapping status:
- Summary of mapped vs unmapped entities
- Summary of mapped vs unmapped relationships
- Count of mapped attributes across all entities
- Overall completion percentage and status

### Visual Mapping Designer

Click **Designer** in the sidebar to use the visual mapping interface. This view provides an interactive force-directed graph of your ontology with color-coded mapping status:

- **Green nodes**: Fully assigned entities (all attributes mapped)
- **Orange nodes**: Partially assigned entities (some attributes missing)
- **Red nodes**: Unassigned entities

#### Mapping Entities

1. Click on any entity node in the graph to open the mapping panel
2. The panel has three tabs:
   - **Wizard**: AI-powered SQL generation using your LLM endpoint and table metadata
   - **SQL**: Direct SQL editing
    - **Mapping**: Interactive column-mapping grid with data preview
3. For **already-assigned** entities, clicking directly loads the Mapping tab and runs the query automatically (direct edit mode)
4. For **new** entities, the Wizard tab opens by default — describe your data and click **Generate** to create SQL
5. In the **Mapping** tab:
   - Click column headers to assign them as ID, Label, or specific attributes
   - Use the **Limit** input to control how many preview rows are shown
   - Click **Refresh** to re-run the query with the current limit
6. Click **Apply** in the panel footer (writes into the session; publish the domain to persist)

> **Note**: The SQL query is stored without a `LIMIT` clause. The preview limit only affects the grid display and is not part of the applied mapping.

**Example SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT person_id, name, email, salary
FROM main.default.person
```

#### Mapping Relationships

1. Click on any relationship line in the graph
2. The same panel opens with Wizard, SQL, and Mapping tabs
3. Assign **Source ID** and **Target ID** columns from query results
4. Click **Apply**

#### Writing SQL Queries for Relationships

Your SQL query should return columns identifying source and target entities.

**Example 1: Simple Foreign Key**
```sql
SELECT person_id, department_id 
FROM main.default.person
WHERE department_id IS NOT NULL
```

**Example 2: Join/Bridge Table**
```sql
SELECT pd.person_id, pd.department_id
FROM main.default.person_department pd
```

**Example 3: Self-referential Relationship**
```sql
SELECT person1_id as source_id, person2_id as target_id
FROM main.default.person_collaboration
```

### Manual Mapping (Sidebar)

Click **Manual** in the sidebar for a tree-based view of all entities and relationships organized by mapping status. The bottom panel shares the same UI and functionality as the Designer view panel — clicking an item opens the same Wizard/SQL/Mapping tabs.

#### Excluding and Including Attributes

By default every ontology attribute is **included** in the mapping. The **Status** tab of the bottom panel shows an attributes table where each row has a checkbox:

- **Checked (✓)** — attribute is included; it must be assigned to a SQL column and will be emitted in the R2RML export.
- **Unchecked** — attribute is excluded; it is shown with strikethrough, skipped in gap reporting, never mapped by Auto-Map, and not emitted in the R2RML export.

To exclude attributes:

1. Open an entity panel (click a node on the canvas).
2. Select the **Status** tab.
3. Uncheck any attributes you do not want to map.
4. Click **Apply** — exclusions are written into the session immediately.

Two bulk-action buttons are available at the top of the attributes table:

- **Exclude all / Include all** — toggles all attributes at once. When all attributes are currently included the button reads *Exclude all*; once any are excluded it switches to *Include all* so you can restore them in one click.
- **Exclude unmapped** — excludes only attributes that have no column assignment yet, leaving already-mapped attributes untouched.

> **Tip:** Exclusions survive an Unmap / re-map cycle. If you right-click an entity and choose **Unmap**, the SQL and column assignments are cleared but the attribute checkboxes stay as you left them. Auto-Map also respects exclusions — it will never map or re-include an excluded attribute.

**Effect on the canvas:** An entity node is green only when every *included* attribute has a column assigned. Excluded attributes do not count towards the orange "attributes missing" indicator.

**Effect on the Auto-Map KPI page:** The Attribute gauge and tile count only included attributes. If you have 14 attributes and exclude 1, the tile shows `13 / 13` (100%) rather than `13 / 14`.

### Auto-Map (Sidebar)

Click **Auto-Map** in the sidebar to batch-assign all unmapped entities and relationships:

1. The page shows counts of unassigned entities and relationships, including how many are excluded (`· N excl.`).
2. If tables or columns are missing `COMMENT` descriptions, a **metadata quality warning** is displayed with a collapsible list and a link to the Domain → Metadata editor. Poor descriptions reduce LLM mapping accuracy.
3. Click **Start Auto-Map** to launch an asynchronous task.
4. Progress is tracked with a progress bar — you can navigate away and return later.
5. Results are displayed in a report table showing success/failure per item.

**Re-Assign Missing Attributes**: If some entities are assigned but have incomplete attribute mappings, a third card appears showing the count and a **Re-Assign Missing Attributes** button. This re-runs auto-mapping only for those specific entities to fill in the missing *included* attribute mappings (excluded attributes are ignored).

### Validate Your Mappings

Mapping validation checks:
- All ontology classes have entity mappings
- All object properties have relationship mappings
- All *included* attributes of mapped entities are assigned to columns (excluded attributes are ignored)
- No missing or incomplete mappings

A green checkmark appears in the navbar when all mappings are complete.

### R2RML Output

The R2RML mapping output is available in the **Domain** section under **R2RML**. Navigate to Domain → R2RML to:
- View the automatically generated R2RML mapping in Turtle format
- Copy to clipboard
- Download as `.ttl` file

---

## Step 3: Knowledge Graph (Sync & Explore)

Navigate to the **Knowledge Graph** page by clicking "Knowledge Graph" in the navigation bar (URL: `/dtwin`).

> **Note**: You need both Ontology and Mapping loaded (green checkmarks in navbar). The Sync page shows a readiness status and disables actions until both are ready.

### Build (Sidebar)

Click **Build** in the sidebar to manage your triple store:

- **Readiness Status**: Shows whether Ontology and mappings (including attribute mappings) are all complete
- **Synchronize**: Generates all triples from your mappings and writes them to the Delta view in Unity Catalog and to the configured Graph DB engine (Lakebase Postgres)
- **Last Updated**: When the table contains data, the status area displays the last modification date and time (for Delta from Unity Catalog metadata; for Lakebase from the Postgres `count_triples` + table metadata)

### Runs (Sidebar)

Click **Runs** in the sidebar (next to **Build**, in the **Management** group) to see the domain's run history. The page has two tabs, each with its own table, newest first — **neither has a version filter, so both always span every version of the domain**:

- **Build runs** (the tab shown first) — one row per synchronize (`Build`) run: ID, date & time, version, status, triple count, and a **Details** button.
- **Analytics runs** — one row per analysis launched from the **Analytics** page, with 11 columns: Date & Time, Scope, Version, Status, Nodes, Edges, Components, Avg Degree, Density, Duration, and **Details**. **Scope** shows the entity type(s) the run was filtered to, or *All types*. **Version** is shown per row because, with no filter, rows from different domain versions interleave in the same list. A **failed** run shows a red **Failed** badge and dashes in its metric columns instead of the zeros it stored internally — a run that errored out is not the same thing as a graph with zero nodes.

Click **Details** on an analytics row to open a modal with the full scope (entity-type local names plus their raw URIs), the graph metrics, the run duration, the background task ID, and any error text if the run failed.

Both tabs are filled when you open the section, whichever one is showing, so switching between them never waits on a fetch. The two load independently: if one fails, the other still renders normally and only the failing tab shows an inline error. The **Refresh** button above the tabs reloads both.

> **Every domain at once.** This page is scoped to the domain you have loaded. From **Settings → Automation → Runs** (admin only) an admin sees the same two tabs across **every** domain in the registry, with a **Domain** column, a **Domain** filter that defaults to *All domains*, and page controls (25 / 50 / 100 rows) — cross-domain history is far too long to show in one list. Both pages read the same registry tables, so a run shows up in both.

### Data Quality (Sidebar)

Click **Data Quality** in the sidebar to run SHACL-based quality checks against the triple store:

- Quality checks run **asynchronously** as a background task with progress tracking
- You can navigate away and return — the task resumes from where it left off
- Validates cardinality, value constraints, property characteristics, and global rules
- Shows pass/fail results with violation details
- Displays the generated SQL for each check

### Explorer (Sidebar)

Click **Explorer** in the sidebar to explore triples as an interactive sigma.js WebGL-powered graph. Triple store data is **automatically loaded** when you navigate to this section:

**Main Graph Area (left):**
- **Nodes**: Entities (colored by class type with emoji icons in labels)
- **Edges**: Relationships between entities
- **Labels**: Entity labels from rdfs:label or mapped label column
- **Hover**: Highlights the hovered entity and its neighbors; dims unrelated nodes
- **Click**: Selects an entity and locks the highlight until another entity or the background is clicked
- **Zoom**: Scroll to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Click and drag background
- **Fit to View**: Click the fullscreen button to fit all entities in view

**Find & Filter:**
- **Find**: Search for entities by label or URI — matching entities and their neighbors are highlighted and the camera zooms to focus on results
- **Filters**: Advanced filtering by entity type, field (label/URI), match type (contains, exact, starts with, ends with), with relationship depth control — rebuilds the graph with only matching triples

**Entity Details Panel (right):**
When you click on an entity in the graph, the right panel shows:
- **Entity Type**: The ontology class (e.g., Person, Department) with icon
- **Entity ID**: The unique identifier
- **Entity Label**: The display name
- **Mapped Attributes**: All attributes defined in the mapping with their values
- **Relationships**: All incoming and outgoing relationships with clickable entity links for navigation
- **Dashboard**: If a dashboard is assigned to this entity type, a "View Dashboard" button appears

**Dashboard Embedding:**
If an entity type has an assigned Databricks dashboard (configured in Ontology → Entities):
1. Click "View Dashboard" in the entity details panel
2. A modal opens with the embedded dashboard
3. Dashboard parameters are automatically populated from entity attributes
4. The dashboard displays data specific to the selected entity

**Note**: Empty entities (type URIs without data) are automatically filtered out.

**Right-click on a node (Expand neighbours):**

Right-click any entity node and pick **Expand neighbours (N hops)** to enrich the displayed graph in place — without re-running a full SPARQL query.

- The hop count follows the **Depth** slider in the right-pane filter panel (default `2`).
- A small spinner appears in the top-right corner of the canvas while the request is running; the rest of the UI stays interactive.
- Newly added entities are merged with the existing graph, briefly ringed with a highlight, and the camera zooms to frame them.
- The same context menu still exposes the existing **View Dashboard**, **Dataset preview**, **Actions** and **Bridges** entries when configured for the entity's class.

**Data Clusters:**

The Graph Viewer includes a **Data Clusters** panel (in the View tab) for detecting communities in the graph:

1. **Detect clusters (local)**: Runs the Louvain community detection algorithm client-side using Graphology on the currently displayed subgraph. Adjust the **Resolution** slider to control cluster granularity (higher = more clusters).
2. **Full graph (backend)**: Sends a request to the server which loads the entire triple store into NetworkX and runs the selected algorithm (Louvain, Label Propagation, or Greedy Modularity) on the full dataset. Use this for large graphs that exceed the visible subgraph.
3. **Color by cluster**: Toggle to recolor nodes by their detected community instead of by entity type.
4. **Collapse / Expand**: Collapse clusters into super-nodes that show the cluster size and member count. Click a collapsed cluster super-node to see its members in the detail panel. Expand individual clusters or all at once.
5. **Clear clusters**: Reset all cluster assignments and return to the default visualization.

The cluster panel also displays:
- Total number of detected clusters
- A color-coded chip list of all clusters with their sizes
- Click a chip to toggle collapse/expand for that cluster

### Analytics (Sidebar)

Click **Analytics** in the sidebar to compute and visualise centrality and structural metrics for the entities in your knowledge graph. Analytics always runs on a **serverless Databricks Lakeflow job** — there is no in-memory or SQL-pushdown fallback.

Because the job can take a while on large graphs, it runs **asynchronously** in the background. The **last** result is persisted in the registry (the `graph_analytics` table), so re-opening the Analytics page (or the Domain Validation cockpit) shows the previously computed result immediately without recomputing — a "Last computed …" line marks when it was produced.

> **Prerequisites.** Three conditions must all be met before a run can start; the Analytics panel tells you which one is missing if any of them fails:
>
> 1. **Admin toggle on** — an admin must enable *Compute large-graph metrics on Databricks* in **Settings → Global**. `ONTOBRICKS_ANALYTICS_JOB_ENABLED` sets the *initial* value for a new deployment; once an admin uses the checkbox their choice wins (including an explicit "off").
> 2. **Job created** — the Lakeflow job (`resources/graph_analytics.job.yml`) must exist in your workspace; this repo no longer deploys it, so create it with your own bundle or the Jobs UI. OntoBricks resolves the job by name (suffix-matching so `[dev <user>]` prefixes work automatically).
> 3. **Domain built** — the domain must have been built at least once after this version of OntoBricks was deployed. Build unconditionally materialises a Delta snapshot of the R2RML-mapped triples (`catalog.schema.triplestore_<domain>_V<n>_data`). If that snapshot is absent or empty, the panel names this requirement and the remedy is a rebuild. Domains built before upgrading to this version need one rebuild.
>
> **What the job scores.** Analytics reads the mapped-triple snapshot — the same table regardless of whether your backend is Lakehouse, Lakebase or Neo4j. Inferred and cohort triples are out of scope; reasoning does not affect the KPIs.
>
> **Betweenness and closeness are estimates.** The job samples `ONTOBRICKS_ANALYTICS_JOB_PIVOTS` source nodes (default **64**) and runs a breadth-first search from each (the Brandes–Pich approach). Both metrics carry an "Estimate" note on the ranking chart. Treat them as a ranking of the clear leaders, not as absolute values. If the BFS hits the depth cap (`ONTOBRICKS_ANALYTICS_JOB_MAX_DEPTH`, default **32**) before the graph is fully explored, betweenness and closeness are withheld entirely — reported as unavailable rather than as numbers — because truncated distance sums would be biased; their distribution tiles then read "Not computed for this run" and the ranking chart explains why. Raise `ONTOBRICKS_ANALYTICS_JOB_MAX_DEPTH` and re-run to resolve this. Set pivots to `0` to skip both metrics and make the job cheaper; setting pivots at or above the node count makes them exact.
>
> **Entity-type counts.** The *Instances* column in the entity-type profile table shows the full population of each class in the mapped graph, including isolated nodes (instances with no relationships). This is a more complete number than earlier releases, which showed only the connected instances on unfiltered runs — types that have isolated nodes will show higher counts.

#### Running an Analysis

1. Click **Run Analysis**. An **Analysis scope** dialog opens, because entity type only takes effect at launch — it is asked for here rather than left in the toolbar, where it could be changed after a run and no longer describe the result on screen.
2. (Optional) Pick an **entity type** to restrict the analysis to one class (e.g. "Customer"). The scope resets to **All types (full graph)** every time the dialog opens, so each run is a deliberate choice. Selecting a type shows only instances of that type in the charts while still computing metrics on the full connected subgraph for accuracy. The filter is applied in SQL inside the Lakeflow job, against the Delta snapshot — not by the graph store — so there is no in-memory limit to work around. **Cancel** closes the dialog without running.
3. Click **Run Analysis** in the dialog to launch. The analysis starts as a background task (tracked in the global task bell, top-right) and a spinner shows on the page behind while it runs — you can keep working elsewhere in the meantime. When it completes, the stored result loads automatically on the **Dashboard** tab: six KPI tiles appear (Nodes, Edges, Components, Avg Degree, Density, Elapsed), a distribution strip of five histogram tiles, and one full-width ranking chart for the selected metric. Each new run replaces the previous stored result for that domain version.

> **Looking for past runs?** The Analytics page itself only ever shows the **last** result per domain version. The full run history — every analysis ever launched, across every version, including failed runs — lives on **Knowledge Graph → Management → Runs** as a second table below the build-runs table (see **Runs (Sidebar)** above).

#### Reading the Dashboard

The **Dashboard** tab has three layers: KPI tiles, a **distribution strip**, and a **ranking chart**.

**Distribution strip.** Five small histogram tiles — PageRank, Betweenness, Degree, Closeness, Clustering — summarise the score distribution across **every scored node in the graph**, not just the top-N shown in the ranking chart. That is the key distinction: the strip answers "is this node's score unusual for the graph as a whole?", while the ranking chart below lists only the top-N leaders for the metric you have selected. Each histogram uses 20 linear bins; the median and p90 shown in the tile caption are **interpolated approximations** from those bin counts (labelled ≈ in the UI). Click a tile to select that metric and redraw the ranking chart; a segmented control in the ranking section header mirrors the selection. Use the **Log scale** switch in the section header toolbar — between the Top N input and the **Run Analysis** button — to redraw all five tiles on a logarithmic count axis — useful for heavy-tailed metrics; the caption notes when log scale is active because bar heights are no longer proportional to raw counts. If betweenness or closeness could not be computed for this run, that tile reads **Not computed for this run** instead of a histogram. Results computed before this redesign (legacy cached payloads) still show KPIs, the ranking chart and the detail table; distribution tiles prompt you to re-run the analysis.

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **PageRank** | Global influence — nodes that are pointed to by other influential nodes rank highest |
| **Betweenness Centrality** | Bridging role — nodes that lie on many shortest paths between other nodes |
| **Degree Centrality** | Raw connectivity — fraction of other nodes this node is directly connected to |
| **Closeness Centrality** | Reachability — how quickly this node can reach every other node in the graph |
| **Clustering Coefficient** | Local density — fraction of a node's neighbors that are also connected to each other |

**Ranking chart.** One full-width horizontal bar chart shows the top-N entities for whichever metric is selected (default PageRank). The ranking chart covers only the bounded top-N slice — unlike the distribution strip above, which spans the whole scored population.

- **Click a bar** to jump directly to that entity in the Graph Viewer (the filter is pre-populated).
- **Hover a bar** to see all five metric scores for that entity in the tooltip.
- **Click the `?` button** on the ranking chart card header to open an explanation popup with the formula, a worked example, and guidance on why the metric matters.

Below the ranking chart, a **PageRank Detail Table** lists the top-N entities with all five metrics displayed as mini progress bars, providing full context for why a node ranks highly. Every row is clickable → Graph Viewer.

#### Data Model Health

After an analysis, a **Data Model Health** card shows entity types that may not benefit from graph storage:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Entity Type** | Class URI local name |
| **Instances** | Count of instances in the graph |
| **Rel. Predicates** | Distinct entity-to-entity relationship predicates (excludes `rdf:type`, `rdfs:label`, and literal attributes; counts both incoming and outgoing relationships) |
| **Temporal** | Whether any camelCase/snake_case token of a predicate name is a temporal keyword (e.g. `date`, `timestamp`, `at`) |

An entity type is flagged as **flat / time-series** when:

- It has **0 relationship predicates** — all instances are fully isolated (no entity-entity relationships)
- It has **exactly 1 relationship predicate** across more than 20 instances — suggests a one-dimensional link

> Types flagged as flat may not rely on graph semantics. Consider **excluding** them from the sync or **replacing individual rows with aggregated facts** in the ontology.

The AI Interpretation agent also mentions flat types in its Key Findings and Recommendations sections.

#### Adjusting the Top-N and Resetting

Use the **Top N** input at the top of the results section to control how many entities the ranking chart and detail table show. To analyse a different class, click **Run Analysis** again and pick the entity type in the **Analysis scope** dialog. The funnel line above the results names the scope the displayed result was computed with.

#### AI Interpretation

After an analysis completes, an **Interpret** button (✦ icon) appears in the toolbar.

1. Click **Interpret** — an AI agent (`agent_graph_interpreter`) calls the configured LLM. The agent may call `get_entity_details` one or more times to look up specific top-ranked entities before writing its insights.
2. The **AI Insights** card renders three structured sections:
   - **Key Findings** — 2–4 sentences on the graph structure and standout patterns
   - **Notable Entities** — up to 5 entities with reasons they stand out; clicking an entity name navigates to the Graph Viewer
   - **Recommendations** — 2–4 actionable suggestions
3. Click **Add to audit trail** (journal icon in the card header) to save the AI insights as a comment on the current domain version. The discussion panel opens automatically so you can see the new entry.

> **Tip**: The LLM endpoint used is the one set in **Domain → Information → LLM Endpoint**. If none is configured, interpretation is unavailable and the Interpret button will not appear after analysis.

#### Discussion Panel

Click the **Discussion** button (chat-bubble icon, top-right of the Analytics toolbar) to open the comments panel for the current domain version. All review decisions and saved AI insights appear here in chronological order with markdown rendering.

### Quality Checks (Sidebar)

Click **Data Quality** in the sidebar to run automated quality checks on your triple store data:

**Running Quality Checks:**
1. Ensure your triple store has been synchronized
2. Click **Run All Checks** button
3. Quality checks run **asynchronously** — a progress bar shows the current check being executed
4. You can navigate away and return; the task resumes from `sessionStorage`
5. Results are displayed with pass/fail status once all checks complete

**Summary Cards:**
- **Passed**: Number of checks that passed (green)
- **Warnings**: Number of checks that couldn't be validated (yellow)
- **Failed**: Number of checks with violations (red)

**Check Categories:**

1. **Cardinality Constraints**: Validates min/max/exact cardinality on relationships
   - Example: "Each Employee must have exactly 1 manager"
   
2. **Value Constraints**: Validates attribute values
   - **contains**: Value must contain a substring (e.g., email contains "@")
   - **startsWith**: Value must start with a prefix
   - **endsWith**: Value must end with a suffix
   - **equals**: Value must exactly match
   - **matches**: Value must match a regex pattern
   
3. **Relationship Properties**: Validates property characteristics
   - **Functional**: Each subject has at most one value
   - **Symmetric**: If A relates to B, then B relates to A
   - **Asymmetric**: If A relates to B, then B cannot relate to A
   - **Irreflexive**: No entity relates to itself
   
4. **Global Rules**: Validates global data integrity
   - **Require Labels**: All entities must have rdfs:label
   - **No Orphans**: No isolated entities (has relationships)

**Viewing Details:**
- Click the **code icon** to view the generated SQL used for the check
- Click the **violations count button** to see detailed violations in a modal
- The violations modal shows a grid with entity URIs and values that failed the check

### Data Quality — SHACL (Sidebar)

Click **Data Quality** in the Knowledge Graph sidebar to run SHACL shape validations against the triple store:

1. Shapes defined in **Ontology → Data Quality** are listed with their category, target class, and severity
2. Click **Run Validation** to execute all enabled shapes
3. Each shape is compiled to SQL and executed against the triple store
4. Results show pass/fail status with violation counts and details
5. For small datasets, PySHACL can validate in-memory without SQL

### Inference (Sidebar)

Click **Inference** in the Knowledge Graph sidebar to run the multi-phase reasoning pipeline:

1. **OWL 2 RL** — Forward-chaining deductive closure on the ontology (infers subclass hierarchies, domain/range typing, property entailments)
2. **SWRL Rules** — Evaluates user-defined rules (violation detection and optional materialization)
3. **Graph Reasoning** — Transitive closure and symmetric expansion based on OWL property characteristics
4. **Constraint Checking** — Validates cardinality, functional properties, value constraints, and global rules

Results are displayed as inferred triples and violations. Inferred triples can be **materialized** (written back) to the triple store.

## Domain Management & Version Control

OntoBricks stores domains in **Unity Catalog Volumes** with built-in version control. Navigate to the **Domain** page by clicking "Domain" in the navigation bar.

### Domain Structure

Each domain is stored as a separate Unity Catalog Volume:
- **Volume Name**: Same as the domain name (sanitized: lowercase, underscores)
- **File Names**: Version numbers (e.g., `v1.json`, `v2.json`, `v3.json`)
- **Contents**: Ontology, mappings, design layout, and domain metadata

**What is Saved:**
- ✅ Ontology (classes, properties, constraints, rules, axioms)
- ✅ Mappings (entity and relationship mappings)
- ✅ Design layout (OntoViz positions and visual configuration)
- ✅ Domain metadata (name, description, author)

**What is NOT Saved (Security):**
- ❌ Databricks credentials (host, token)
- ❌ Query results
- ❌ R2RML output (regenerated on load)
- ❌ Generated OWL (regenerated on load)

### Domain Information (Global Tab)

The **Global** tab in the Domain Information section contains the main domain settings:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Domain Name** | CamelCase, alphanumeric only (e.g. `MyOntologyDomain`). Defaults to `NewDomain`. Non-alphanumeric characters are stripped automatically and words are capitalized as you type. |
| **Version** | Current version number with version selector. |
| **Base URI** | The base namespace for all ontology entities. By default, auto-generated from `Settings → Default Base URI Domain / DomainName#`. Toggle the **Custom** switch to enter a custom URI. |
| **Description** | Free-text description of the domain. |
| **Author** | Automatically pre-filled with the current Databricks user email. Editable. |
| **API / MCP** | Toggle **Expose via API & MCP** to make this domain visible through the REST API (`/api/v1/domains`) and the MCP server. Disabled by default. |

#### Triple Store Tab

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Backend** | Select the Graph DB engine for this domain (`lakebase`, `databricks` / Lakehouse, or `neo4j`). Build always also creates the Unity Catalog triple-store family below. |
| **Triple-Store** | Read-only. Base name in the domain's registry `catalog.schema`: `triplestore_<domain>_V<version>`. Build creates four related objects from that base (see below). |
| **Graph DB table** | Read-only. For Lakebase, the flat triple table name is derived as `g_<domain>_v<version>` in the configured Postgres schema (default `ontobricks_graph`). |

When you **commit** the domain name (blur the field or trigger `change`) or change the **Version**, the Triple Store FQN and Graph DB table name are **recomputed** so they match the naming rules the server will use on save — without waiting for a round-trip.

**Lakehouse objects created by Build** (always, in the registry `catalog.schema`):

| Object | Kind | What it is for |
|--------|------|----------------|
| `triplestore_<domain>_V<n>` | VIEW | Live R2RML mapping over your source tables |
| `…_data` | Delta TABLE | Materialised mapped triples — what **Analytics** reads; also the bulk half of the graph |
| `…_inferred` | Delta TABLE | Reasoning / cohort / app-written triples |
| `…_graph` | VIEW | `_data ∪ _inferred` — what Explorer and most graph reads use |

Full detail: [Architecture → Lakehouse Unity Catalog objects](architecture.md#lakehouse-unity-catalog-objects).

**Backend details:**

| Backend | Storage | Sync | Best for |
|---------|---------|------|----------|
| **Lakehouse (Delta)** | The UC objects above (SQL Warehouse) | Build CTAS + companion tables | Unity Catalog governance, analytics on the mapped snapshot, no separate graph DB |
| **Lakebase Postgres** | Flat `(subject, predicate, object)` table on the App-bound Lakebase instance | App-managed (`COPY FROM STDIN`) or managed-synced (Lakeflow) | Low-latency reads from the FastAPI process, reasoning, BFS / cohort builds |
| **Neo4j** | Bolt-connected property graph | Build `MERGE` of mapped triples | Cypher traversal workloads |

**Performance:**
- **Delta** materialises the R2RML VIEW into `_data` with **Liquid Clustering** (`CLUSTER BY (predicate, subject)`), co-locating rows by predicate and subject for faster filtering. After each build, an `OPTIMIZE` runs on `_data` to compact files and apply the clustering layout. Interactive reads typically hit the `_graph` union VIEW.
- **Lakebase** stores triples in Postgres flat tables. Two modes are available: `app_managed` (the app streams batches via `COPY FROM STDIN`, idempotent on `(subject, predicate, object)`) and `managed_synced` (Databricks Lakeflow keeps a synced table in lock-step with the mapped Delta snapshot, while a writable companion table absorbs reasoning/cohort writes — the read view UNIONs both).

### Saving Domains

#### First Save

1. Go to **Domain** page
2. Fill in domain details:
   - **Name**: Domain name in CamelCase (becomes the volume folder name)
   - **Description**: Optional description
   - **Author**: Your name (auto-filled from Databricks)
3. Select **Catalog** and **Schema** for storage
4. Click **Save to Unity Catalog**

If a domain with the **same sanitized folder name** already exists in the registry, the save is **blocked** (inline validation on the domain name and a final check when you confirm save) — pick a different CamelCase name.

OntoBricks will:
1. Create a volume named after your domain (if it doesn't exist)
2. Save the domain as `v{version}.json`

#### Subsequent Saves

When you save an existing domain:
- The current version file is **overwritten**
- Use **Create New Version** to preserve history

### Domain Cockpit (Validation)

Under **Domain → Validation** (Cockpit), tiles summarise registry and build readiness. The **Published Version** tile shows which registry version is currently **exposed via API and MCP** — the numeric-latest version whose lifecycle status is **PUBLISHED**. That can differ from the version you have **loaded** in the editor; when it does, the tile adds a *(not loaded)* hint.

#### Version lifecycle (DRAFT / IN-REVIEW / PUBLISHED)

Every domain version carries a **lifecycle status**, shown as a colour-coded badge wherever the domain + version appears (navbar, Domain → Information, Registry → Browse, Domain → Versions, and the query headers):

- **DRAFT** (amber) — editable. New versions always start here.
- **IN-REVIEW** (blue) — locked for editing, pending review. Requires a successful build first.
- **PUBLISHED** (green) — locked for editing and served on the API/MCP.

Transitions are made from **Registry → Browse** (or Domain → Information):
DRAFT → IN-REVIEW → PUBLISHED (admin or builder), IN-REVIEW → DRAFT (admin or builder), and PUBLISHED → DRAFT (admin only). While a version is **not DRAFT**, the ontology/mapping editors, metadata/document writes, and the **Build** (`/dtwin/sync/start`) and **Load** (`/dtwin/sync/load`) actions are blocked server-side — set it back to **DRAFT** to rebuild. Read-only Knowledge Graph operations (Explorer filter/expand, stats, status, etc.) remain fully accessible regardless of lifecycle status.

#### Single-editor concurrency (open in edit vs. view) & the Close button

To keep two people from silently overwriting each other, a **DRAFT** version can only be
**edited by one user at a time**:

- The **first** person to open a DRAFT domain gets it in **edit mode**.
- Anyone who opens the **same** domain/version afterwards gets it **read-only (view mode)**,
  with a banner naming the current editor. All write surfaces are disabled — they can still
  browse, query and inspect everything.
- The lock is **held until the editor explicitly closes the domain**, or until their
  editing session goes idle for the lease period (10 minutes by default). Simply navigating
  around the app keeps the lease alive automatically, and closing a tab does **not** hand the
  domain to someone else straight away — the editor keeps it until they click **Close** or
  the lease lapses. The editor's browser quietly renews the lease in the background while the
  domain is open, so an actively-used session never expires. **Hover the domain name in the
  top navbar** while you are editing to see a live countdown of the remaining lease (the time
  before it would expire if the tab went idle).
- **Opening a different domain closes the current one for you.** Loading another domain
  (navbar **Load Domain**, or **Registry → Browse → Load**) releases your lock on the
  previously-open domain **before** the new one opens, so you never hold two locks at once.
  Switching to another **version of the same domain** releases the old version's lock
  **after** the new version loads.

**Closing a domain** — the top sub-navigation shows three buttons: **Save** (persist the
domain to the registry), **Switch**, and **Close**. Clicking **Close** asks whether to *save
before closing* (**Save & Close** / **Close without saving** / **Cancel**), then releases the
edit lock and returns you to the Home page. Once you close, the next person can open the
domain in edit mode.

**Switching version** — the **Versions** button (between **Save** and **Close**) opens a popup
listing every version of the currently open domain, with the current one flagged. Pick the
current version to **reload** it from the Registry (discarding in-session edits) or another
version to **switch** to it. On a **DRAFT** version, a *"Save my changes before switching"*
box is ticked by default — leave it on to persist your work first, or untick it to discard
unsaved changes. On an **IN-REVIEW** or **PUBLISHED** version the version picker stays
available but the save option is disabled (those versions are read-only).

**Stuck lock?** A lock left behind (e.g. a browser that crashed without closing) clears
itself: once its lease lapses (no renew for the TTL, 10 minutes by default) the next person
to open the version silently reclaims it — no admin action needed. If the original editor
comes back after that, they see a *"your editing session expired"* banner and can **Reload**
to reconnect (regaining edit if no one else has taken over). For an immediate hand-off there
are also two manual paths:

- An **app-admin** viewing the locked version gets a **Take over editing** button that
  reclaims the lock; the previous editor becomes read-only on their next page load.
- From **Settings → Admin → Locks** (admin only), an admin sees *every* active edit-lock
  across the registry — domain, version, lifecycle status, who holds it, when it was
  acquired, and whether its lease has gone stale — and can **force-unlock** any of them
  without opening that domain first (a confirmation dialog names the domain, version, and
  holder).

> The lease TTL is configurable from **Settings → Global → Edit Lock Lease (minutes)**
> (admin-only; default 10 min). It can also be set via the `ONTOBRICKS_EDIT_LOCK_TTL_S`
> environment variable (seconds; default `600`) — the Settings value takes precedence over
> the env var when set. Set either to `0` to disable auto-expiry entirely and require an
> explicit Close / admin take-over, as in earlier releases.

A version also releases its lock automatically when it leaves DRAFT (submitted for review /
published). The read-only banner and the sidebar role badge both name the current holder,
so viewers know exactly who to ask to close the domain.

> The same user opening the domain in two tabs shares one lock (it is keyed by e-mail), so
> a reload or a second tab never locks you out of your own domain.

#### Validation & Review workflow (My Tasks + Domain → Validation)

For a guided, business-user-oriented review on top of the raw lifecycle, OntoBricks adds a
review workflow that collects reviewer sign-offs and keeps a durable audit trail.

- **Home → My Tasks** — a cross-domain worklist of the versions that need *you* (shown on
  the home page when you have pending items). Each row shows the domain, version, status,
  sign-off progress, and the action available to you: **Submit for review** (builders/admins,
  on a built DRAFT), **Review & sign off** (any domain member, on an IN-REVIEW version), or
  **Publish** (builders/admins, once the quorum is met). "Review & sign off" loads the domain
  and opens its Validation workspace.
- **Domain → Validation** — the per-version review workspace:
  - **Consistency checks** — a soft readiness summary (ontology valid, mapping complete,
    warehouse configured, Knowledge Graph built) with shortcuts to the Cockpit and Pitfalls.
    These checks are advisory and never block publishing.
  - **Your actions** — context-aware buttons: Submit for review, **Approve** / **Request
    changes** (with an optional comment for the audit trail), Publish, or Reopen.
  - **Audit trail** — a timeline of every decision (submitted, approved, changes requested,
    published, reopened) with the actor, timestamp, comment, and the `from → to` status
    snapshot for lifecycle transitions.
- **Roles & quorum** — Submit and Publish stay builder/admin. **Publish** unlocks for a
  builder only once the **sign-off quorum** is reached; an **admin** (app-level or domain-level)
  may **publish at any time, overriding the quorum** (the override is flagged in the audit
  trail). The quorum is a **per-domain** setting (default `1`), configured on
  **Domain → Information → Global** ("Sign-off quorum") and applied to every version of that
  domain. **Sign-off** (approve / request changes) is open to any principal with a role on the
  domain; **request changes** sends the version back to DRAFT for editing. **Reopen**
  (PUBLISHED → DRAFT) is admin-only.
- **Persistence** — every decision is stored append-only in the `domain_review_events`
  registry table, so the full "who validated what, when" history survives restarts and is
  queryable.

### Version Management (Domain → Versions)

1. Open **Domain** in the sidebar and go to the **Versions** section.
2. The table lists every saved version with description, author, and actions.
3. **MCP / API** column: read-only — a green **Active** badge marks the single version currently exposed through the REST catalogue and MCP tools. To **change** which version is Active, go to **Registry → Browse**, expand the domain, and click **Set as Active** on the desired version (Domain → Versions no longer includes a toggle).
4. **Load** loads another version from the registry (confirms; unsaved work is lost).
5. **New Version** copies the current state to the next version number; **Reload Saved** discards local edits and reloads the current version from the registry.

#### Creating a New Version

1. **Domain** → **Versions** → **New Version**.
2. OntoBricks increments the version number, saves under `/domains/<folder>/V<n>/`, and keeps prior versions.

#### Loading a Domain from Registry

1. Use **Load Domain** in the top navbar (or **Registry → Browse** → **Load** on a version row).
2. Pick domain and version in the dialog. Loading an **older** than latest version enables read-only mode for edits that require the tip version — create a new version or switch back to the latest to edit freely.

### Version status (loaded vs latest vs MCP-active)

Three related ideas:

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Loaded version** | The `v{n}` document currently in your browser session. |
| **Latest on disk** | Highest version number in the registry folder. When your loaded version is **not** the latest, the UI treats many writes as read-only. |
| **Active (API/MCP)** | The one version flagged for external tools and MCP — shown on the Cockpit **Active Version** tile and as a badge on **Domain → Versions**; changed only from **Registry → Browse**. |

### Domain Save/Load

Domains are saved in a versioned JSON format and can be stored in Unity Catalog Volumes. Use the **Save** button (in the domain sub-navigation) and the **Load Domain** option in the top menu to persist and restore your work; the **Versions** button reloads the current domain or loads another of its versions from the Registry, and the **Close** button releases the edit lock and returns you to the Home page.

### Best Practices for Version Control

1. **Version Before Major Changes**: Create a new version before significant ontology modifications
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose domain names that clearly identify the subject area
3. **Document Versions**: Use the description field to note changes between versions
4. **Regular Saves**: Save frequently to avoid losing work
5. **Test After Loading**: Verify R2RML regeneration after loading older versions

---

## Best Practices

### Ontology Design

1. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose clear, descriptive names
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use CamelCase for classes, camelCase for properties
3. **Start Simple**: Begin with core entities, add complexity later
4. **Use the Visual Designer**: The Design view makes it easy to see relationships
5. **Choose Good Icons**: Visual icons help identify entities in graphs
6. **Set Relationship Directions**: Be explicit about data flow direction
7. **Use Inheritance Wisely**: Create class hierarchies for shared attributes
8. **Avoid Deep Hierarchies**: Keep inheritance chains shallow (2-3 levels max)

### Mapping Strategy

1. **Map Core Entities First**: Start with main entity types
2. **Verify ID Columns**: Ensure IDs are unique and stable
3. **Test SQL Queries**: Always test relationship queries before saving
4. **Use Consistent Column Types**: Source/target columns should match entity IDs
5. **Exclude Irrelevant Attributes Early**: Before running Auto-Map, open each entity's Status tab and uncheck attributes you don't need. Auto-Map will skip excluded attributes, producing leaner SQL with no extra columns.
6. **Quote Special Column Names**: If a source column contains spaces, hyphens, or dots, use backtick quoting in your SQL (`` `column name` AS column_name ``) so the mapping and R2RML export work correctly.
7. **Use Metadata Quality Warning**: Check the Auto-Map page for the metadata quality warning before running Auto-Map — adding table and column descriptions in Domain → Metadata significantly improves mapping accuracy.

### Knowledge Graph Tips

1. **Sync After Changes**: Re-synchronize after modifying ontology or mappings
2. **Check Quality**: Run quality checks after syncing to catch constraint violations early
3. **Use Graph Viewer**: The interactive graph is the best way to explore entity relationships
4. **Review Triples**: Browse the triples grid to verify the generated data looks correct
5. **Performance**: The `/stats` API aggregates all scalar metrics in a single SQL query and the `/triples/find` BFS traversal uses a recursive CTE, minimizing SQL Warehouse round trips
6. **Programmatic Access**: Use the Knowledge Graph API (`/api/v1/digitaltwin/`) or the MCP server for programmatic and conversational access to your graph viewer
7. **Use Analytics for Governance**: Run the Analytics section after each sync to spot high-influence entities (PageRank), bottlenecks (Betweenness), and isolated sub-graphs (connected components count > 1). Use the AI Interpretation feature to get an instant narrative summary of the graph structure.
8. **Save Insights to Audit Trail**: After interpreting analytics results, click **Add to audit trail** to keep a record of the AI-generated observations in the domain's review history.

## GraphQL API

Once your triple store is materialized (synced via Knowledge Graph), OntoBricks automatically provides a **typed GraphQL API** for each domain. The schema is auto-generated from the ontology — no manual configuration required.

### Accessing GraphQL

1. Navigate to **Knowledge Graph** → **API** and scroll to the **GraphQL API** section
2. Alternatively, visit `/graphql/{domain_name}` to open the **GraphiQL Playground** directly

### Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/graphql` | GET | List all GraphQL-enabled domains |
| `/graphql/{domain_name}` | GET | Open GraphiQL playground for a domain |
| `/graphql/{domain_name}` | POST | Execute a GraphQL query |
| `/graphql/{domain_name}/schema` | GET | Get the SDL (Schema Definition Language) |

### Querying with GraphQL

The auto-generated schema provides two resolvers per ontology class:
- **`all<ClassName>`**: List entities with optional `limit`, `offset`, and `search` parameters
- **`<className>`**: Fetch a single entity by `id`

**Example query** (for an ontology with `Customer` and `Interaction` classes):

```graphql
{
  allCustomer(limit: 10, search: "Smith") {
    id
    label
    email
    hasInteraction {
      label
      date
    }
  }
}
```

### Schema Introspection

Use the SDL endpoint to inspect the full schema:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/graphql/my_domain/schema
```

This returns the complete type definitions, which is useful for integrating with external tools or for LLM agents to discover the data model programmatically.

### Tips

1. **Nested Traversal**: Unlike flat triple queries, GraphQL lets you traverse relationships (e.g., `customer → interactions → details`) in a single query
2. **Schema Reflects Ontology**: If you add new classes or properties, re-sync the triple store and the GraphQL schema updates automatically
3. **GraphiQL Auto-Complete**: The playground provides documentation and auto-complete for all types and fields

### Relationship Depth Control

GraphQL queries support configurable traversal depth for nested relationships:

- **Default depth**: 2 (direct neighbors and their neighbors)
- **Maximum depth**: 5
- **How to set**: Use the **Depth** dropdown in the GraphiQL playground, or include `"depth": N` in the POST request body

Higher depth values allow deeper nested traversal (e.g., `customer → interaction → contract → meter`) but may increase query time.

## MCP Server (Databricks Playground)

OntoBricks includes an MCP server that exposes knowledge-graph tools to LLM clients via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This enables conversational access to your graph viewer from the Databricks Playground, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_domains` | List all domains with ≥1 PUBLISHED version in the registry |
| `select_domain` | Activate a domain for subsequent queries |
| `list_domain_versions` | List registry versions for a domain |
| `get_design_status` | Ontology / metadata / assignment readiness for a domain |
| `list_entity_types` | Overview of entity types, counts, and predicates |
| `describe_entity` | Full-text description of an entity with BFS traversal |
| `get_entity_context` | Linked dataset rows, cross-domain bridges, and class actions for a node |
| `invoke_entity_action` | Run a Unity Catalog function action on an entity (entity ID passed as the single argument) |
| `get_graphql_schema` | Auto-generated GraphQL schema (SDL) for the domain |
| `query_graphql` | Execute a GraphQL query with structured results |
| `get_status` | Triple store diagnostic (view, graph, count) |

### Using in Databricks Playground

1. Deploy the MCP server as `mcp-ontobricks` (see [Deployment Guide](deployment.md))
2. In your Databricks workspace, navigate to **Playground**
3. Select **mcp-ontobricks** from the MCP Servers list
4. Ask questions like *"What entity types are in the graph viewer?"* or *"Tell me about Jacob Martinez"*

### Enabling Domains for MCP

Domains must have the **API / MCP** flag enabled to be visible through the MCP server:

1. Go to **Domain > Information > Global** tab
2. Toggle **Expose via API & MCP** to ON
3. Save the domain

See the [MCP Server documentation](mcp.md) for full details including local usage and client configuration.

## Example: HR Domain

### Step 1: Design Ontology (Using Visual Designer)

1. Open **Ontology** → **Design**
2. Create entities:
   - 👤 Person (add attributes: name, email)
   - 👔 Manager (add attributes: managementLevel)
   - 🏢 Department (add attributes: departmentName)
   - 📋 Project (add attributes: projectTitle, budget)
3. Create inheritance:
   - Click the △ button in the toolbar
   - Drag from Person to Manager → Manager inherits name and email from Person
4. Create relationships:
   - Drag from Person to Department → name it "worksIn" (Forward)
   - Drag from Manager to Project → name it "manages" (Forward)
   - Drag from Person to Person → name it "collaboratesWith" (Bidirectional)
5. Use **Auto Layout** to organize the diagram
6. Click **Center** to fit everything in view

### Step 2: Create Mappings (Mapping)

1. Open **Mapping** → **Designer**
2. Click on each entity to configure its mapping:

**Entity Mappings:**
| Class | Table | ID Column |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Person | person | person_id |
| Department | department | department_id |
| Project | project | project_id |

3. Click on each relationship to configure its mapping:

**Relationship Mappings:**
| Property | SQL Query | Source Col | Target Col |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| worksIn | `SELECT person_id, dept_id FROM person_department` | person_id | dept_id |
| manages | `SELECT manager_id, project_id FROM project_managers` | manager_id | project_id |
| collaboratesWith | `SELECT person1_id, person2_id FROM collaborations` | person1_id | person2_id |

### Step 3: Explore (Knowledge Graph)

1. Go to **Knowledge Graph** → **Status** and click **Synchronize** to generate triples from your mappings
2. Once synced, click **Triples** to browse all generated triples in a sortable grid
3. Click **Explorer** to explore the graph viewer as an interactive sigma.js WebGL graph
4. Click on any entity node to see its type, label, attributes, and values in the details panel
5. Click **Data Quality** to run automated quality checks against your ontology constraints

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Connection failed" error

**Solutions**:
- Verify Databricks host URL is correct (include `https://`)
- Check token has not expired
- Ensure SQL Warehouse is running
- Verify network connectivity

### No Tables Showing

**Problem**: Empty table list in mapping modal

**Solutions**:
- Verify catalog and schema names are correct
- Check permissions on the schema
- Ensure tables exist in the schema

### Query Test Fails

**Problem**: SQL query test returns error

**Solutions**:
- Check SQL syntax
- Verify table and column names
- Ensure you have SELECT permissions
- Only SELECT queries are allowed

### Empty Graph Viewer

**Problem**: Graph shows no nodes or edges

**Solutions**:
- Ensure the triple store has been synchronized (check Triples section)
- Verify relationships exist in data
- Click "Fit to View" button
- Click the reload button to re-render the graph
- Check browser console for errors

### Mapping Validation Fails

**Problem**: Error when validating mappings

**Solutions**:
- Ensure all ontology classes are mapped (via Mapping → Designer)
- Check all object properties have relationship mappings
- Verify all entity attributes are assigned to SQL columns (check for orange indicators in Designer view)
- Use Auto-Map → Re-Assign Missing Attributes to fix incomplete attribute mappings
- Verify table and column names match

### Lakebase Graph Empty After Restart

**Problem**: Triples are missing from the Graph DB after the App restarts

**Solutions**:
- Lakebase Postgres is the source of truth for the graph engine — verify the App is bound to the Lakebase instance (`PGHOST` / `PGDATABASE` env vars set by the Apps runtime)
- If the Lakebase instance was paused or scaled to zero, the connection layer retries on `SQLSTATE 57P03`. Wait a few seconds and re-trigger the build.
- Re-run the Knowledge Graph sync — the build is idempotent (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)

### Design Changes Not Saving

**Problem**: Changes in Design view are not persisted

**Solutions**:
- Wait for the "Saving..." indicator to complete
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you have network connectivity
- Try refreshing the page

### Relationship Direction Issues

**Problem**: Direction not displaying correctly

**Solutions**:
- Click the direction button (→/←/↔) to cycle through options
- Verify the direction is set in both Design and Relationships views
- Check that source and target entities are correctly identified

## Automated triple-store pipeline (merged)

## Automated Triple Store Creation

This guide walks you through creating a fully populated **graph viewer triple store** from scratch using OntoBricks' automated features. With LLM-powered ontology generation, automatic data mapping, and one-click synchronization, you can go from raw Databricks tables to a queryable triple store in minutes.

---

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A **Databricks workspace** with tables in Unity Catalog
- A **SQL Warehouse** (Serverless or Classic)
- An **OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint** (for LLM features), set per deployment via `ONTOBRICKS_LLM_BASE_URL` / `ONTOBRICKS_LLM_API_KEY` / `ONTOBRICKS_LLM_MODEL`. OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, vLLM, Ollama, a LiteLLM proxy, or Databricks Foundation Model APIs at `https://<workspace>/serving-endpoints` — Databricks is one provider here, not a requirement
- A **Personal Access Token** with permissions to read tables and execute queries

---

### Overview

The automated pipeline follows these steps:

```
Step 1: Configure connection
        │
Step 2: Set up domain (LLM endpoint, triple store table)
        │
Step 3: Import table metadata from Unity Catalog
        │
Step 4: Generate ontology with the Wizard (LLM-powered)
        │
Step 5: Auto-Map data mappings (LLM-powered)
        │
Step 6: Synchronize to the triple store
        │
Step 7: Validate with quality checks
        │
        ▼
   Knowledge graph ready
```

---

### Step 1: Configure Databricks Connection

Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon in the top-right corner).

1. Enter your **Databricks Host** URL (e.g., `https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com`).
2. Enter your **Personal Access Token**.
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity.
4. Select a **SQL Warehouse** from the dropdown list.
5. Click **Save**.

The connection status indicator in the navbar should turn green.

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Domain

Navigate to **Domain** in the top navbar, then open the **Information** sidebar section.

1. Enter a **Domain Name** (e.g., `CustomerAnalytics`).
2. Set the **Base URI** for your ontology (e.g., `https://ontobricks.com/ontology/`). This is the namespace for all generated RDF resources.
3. Select the **Model** from the dropdown. The dropdown lists the models the deployment declares in `ONTOBRICKS_LLM_MODELS`; leaving it empty uses `ONTOBRICKS_LLM_MODEL`. The provider and credential are not editable here — an API key does not belong in a settings table.
4. Configure the **Triple Store Table**: select a catalog, schema, and table name where triples will be stored (e.g., `my_catalog.my_schema.triples`). The table will be created automatically during sync.

---

### Step 3: Import Table Metadata

Navigate to **Domain > Metadata** in the sidebar.

This step tells OntoBricks about the Databricks tables you want to model in your ontology.

1. Select a **Catalog** from the dropdown.
2. Select a **Schema** from the dropdown.
3. Click **List Tables** to see all available tables.
4. **Check the tables** you want to include in your ontology (or use "Select All").
5. Click **Initialize Metadata**.

OntoBricks fetches column names, types, and comments from Unity Catalog for each selected table. This metadata is used by the Wizard and Auto-Map features to understand your data structure.

> **Tip**: Include all tables that are relevant to the domain you want to model. The more context the LLM has, the better the ontology and mappings will be.

---

### Step 4: Generate the Ontology with the Wizard

Navigate to **Ontology** in the top navbar, then open **Generate** in the sidebar.

The Wizard uses your LLM endpoint and the imported metadata to automatically design an ontology.

1. You'll see the list of tables loaded from metadata. **Check the tables** you want the LLM to consider.
2. **(Optional)** Click a **Quick Template** button to pre-fill domain-specific guidelines:
   - **CRM** — customers, contacts, accounts, opportunities
   - **E-Commerce** — products, categories, orders, payments
   - **IoT** — devices, sensors, measurements, locations
   - **Healthcare** — patients, providers, appointments, diagnoses
   - **Energy** — energy-sector customer relationship management
3. Review or edit the **guidelines** text area. You can add specific instructions like "Create a Customer entity with relationships to Contract and Invoice."
4. Configure generation options:
   - **Include Data Properties** — generate attributes for entities
   - **Include Relationships** — generate relationships between entities
   - **Include Inheritance** — generate class hierarchies
   - **Use Table Names** — use original table names as entity names
   - **Use Column Comments** — use UC column comments in descriptions
5. Click **Generate**.
6. The LLM generates an OWL ontology in Turtle format. You can **preview** the result.
7. Click **Apply** to import the generated ontology into your domain.

After applying, switch to the **Model** view in the sidebar to see the visual ontology with entities, relationships, and inheritance links.

> **Tip**: You can edit the generated ontology afterwards — add or remove entities, rename relationships, set icons, adjust attributes.

---

### Step 5: Auto-Map Data Mappings

Navigate to **Mapping** in the top navbar, then open **Auto-Map** in the sidebar.

Auto-Map uses the LLM to automatically generate SQL queries that map each ontology entity and relationship to your Databricks tables.

1. Review the list of **unmapped entities** and **unmapped relationships**.
2. Click **Start Auto-Map**.
3. OntoBricks processes each entity and relationship:
   - Sends the entity name, attributes, and metadata context to the LLM
   - The LLM generates a SQL query (SELECT statement)
   - The SQL is validated by executing it against the SQL warehouse
   - Column mappings are inferred (ID, Label, and attribute columns)
4. A progress bar shows the mapping progress.
5. When complete, review the results — successfully mapped items show in green.
6. Click **Apply All** to save all mappings to the domain.

You can verify individual mappings by switching to the **Designer** view:
- **Green** nodes = fully assigned (all attributes mapped)
- **Orange** nodes = partially assigned (some attributes missing)
- **Red** nodes = unassigned

> **Tip**: If some entities remain unassigned or partially assigned, you can click on them in the Designer view to manually edit or regenerate their SQL mapping.

---

### Step 6: Synchronize to the Triple Store

Navigate to **Knowledge Graph** in the top navbar. The **Status** section opens by default.

Before syncing, OntoBricks validates readiness:
- **Ontology**: At least one entity with a valid URI
- **Entity Mappings**: All entities have SQL assignments
- **Relationship Mappings**: All relationships have SQL assignments

If all checks pass:

1. Click **Synchronize**.
2. OntoBricks:
   - Generates R2RML mappings from your entity and relationship assignments
   - Translates the mappings into Spark SQL queries
   - Executes the queries against your SQL warehouse
   - Creates the triple store table (Delta format) with columns: `subject`, `predicate`, `object`
   - Inserts all generated triples
3. A progress indicator shows the sync status.
4. When complete, you'll see the **triple count** and **last updated timestamp**.

> **Note**: If the triple store table already exists, you can choose to **drop and recreate** it or append to the existing data.

> **Triple Store Backend**: OntoBricks always materializes a Delta view in Unity Catalog (governance + lineage) and a flat triple table in the domain's Graph DB engine (Lakebase Postgres, Lakehouse, or Neo4j). The backend is chosen **per domain** under **Domain → Information → Knowledge Graph** (engine *connection* settings live under **Settings → Back end**).

---

### Step 7: Validate with Quality Checks

Still in the **Knowledge Graph** section, open **Data Quality** in the sidebar.

Quality checks validate the triple store against your ontology using two complementary systems:

#### Legacy Constraint Checks
These check OWL property constraints defined in the ontology:

| Check | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Cardinality** | Min/max/exact property counts per entity |
| **Functional** | At most one value per subject for a property |
| **Inverse Functional** | At most one subject per object for a property |
| **Symmetric** | If A→B exists, B→A must also exist |
| **Asymmetric** | No symmetric pairs allowed |
| **Irreflexive** | No self-referencing triples |
| **Require Labels** | All entities have rdfs:label |
| **No Orphans** | No entities with only type and label |

#### SHACL Data Quality Shapes
Define fine-grained rules using the W3C SHACL standard (Ontology > Data Quality sidebar):

| Shape Type | What It Validates |
|------------|-------------------|
| **sh:minCount / sh:maxCount** | Required fields, exact cardinality |
| **sh:datatype** | Value type (integer, date, boolean, string) |
| **sh:pattern** | Regex pattern matching |
| **sh:hasValue** | Required specific values |
| **sh:class** | Object must be of a specific type |
| **sh:sparql** | Custom SPARQL-based rules (e.g., no orphans, unique IDs) |

SHACL shapes are compiled to **Spark SQL** and executed on the SQL warehouse against the triple-store VIEW, whatever graph engine the domain uses. Results show violations, pass rates, and per-entity details.

1. Click **Run All Checks** to execute all applicable checks, or run individual checks.

2. Results show pass/fail for each check with details on any violations.
3. Use the results to identify data quality issues in your source tables or ontology design.

---

### Step 7b: Run Reasoning (Optional)

Still in the **Knowledge Graph** section, open **Inference** in the sidebar.

Reasoning discovers new facts (inferred triples) from your ontology rules:

1. Select the reasoning **phases** to run:
   - **T-Box (OWL 2 RL)**: Infers class hierarchies, property inheritance, and domain/range constraints
   - **SWRL Rules**: Executes your custom business rules (e.g., "if Person hasParent Parent and Parent hasParent Grandparent, then Person hasGrandparent Grandparent")
   - **Structural**: Applies transitivity, symmetry, and other property characteristics
2. Optionally enable **Materialization** to write inferred triples back to the triple store
3. Click **Start Reasoning**
4. Review the inferred triples — each shows the source rule and reasoning phase

> **Note**: Reasoning is most effective when you have SWRL rules defined (Ontology > Business Rules) and a rich ontology with property characteristics.

---

### Step 8: Explore Your Graph Viewer

After sync, you can explore the triple store:

#### Graph Explorer
Open **Explorer** in the sidebar to explore the graph viewer interactively:
- **Find** specific entities by name, type, or URI — matching entities and their neighbors are highlighted
- **Filter** by entity type, field, match type, and relationship depth
- **Navigate** relationships — click an entity to see its attributes, values, and connected entities in the detail panel
- **Toggle labels** for node and edge labels
- **Hide orphans** to focus on connected entities

---

### Complete Workflow Summary

| Step | Where | Action | Automated? |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Settings | Configure Databricks connection | Manual (one-time) |
| 2 | Domain > Information | Set LLM endpoint and triple store table | Manual (one-time) |
| 3 | Domain > Metadata | Import table metadata from Unity Catalog | One click |
| 4 | Ontology > Generate | Generate ontology from metadata using LLM | One click |
| 5 | Mapping > Auto-Map | Auto-map entities and relationships to SQL | One click |
| 6 | Knowledge Graph > Build | Synchronize to triple store | One click |
| 7 | Knowledge Graph > Data Quality | Run quality checks | One click |

After the initial one-time configuration (steps 1–2), the entire pipeline from metadata to triple store is **four clicks**: Import Metadata, Generate, Auto-Map, Synchronize.

---

### Tips for Best Results

- **Table and column naming**: The LLM performs best when table and column names are descriptive. If your tables use cryptic names, add **comments** in Unity Catalog before importing metadata.
- **Start with a template**: Use one of the Wizard quick-templates (CRM, IoT, etc.) if your domain matches — it provides better guidelines for the LLM.
- **Review before syncing**: After auto-map, quickly review the Designer view. Fix any red or orange nodes before synchronizing.
- **Iterate**: The pipeline is not a one-shot process. You can re-generate the ontology, re-run auto-map, or manually adjust individual mappings at any time.
- **Save your domain**: After achieving a good result, save the domain to Unity Catalog (**Save** in the domain sub-navigation) so you can reload it later.

---

### REST API — Programmatic Pipeline

The full pipeline is also available via REST API for automation or CI/CD integration:

```bash
## Step 3: Import metadata
curl -X POST /domain/metadata/initialize-async \
  -d '{"catalog": "my_catalog", "schema": "my_schema", "tables": ["t1", "t2"]}'

## Step 4: Generate ontology
curl -X POST /ontology/wizard/generate-async \
  -d '{"metadata": {...}, "guidelines": "...", "options": {...}}'

## Step 4b: Apply generated ontology
curl -X POST /ontology/import-owl \
  -d '{"content": "<turtle content>"}'

## Step 5: Auto-Map
curl -X POST /mapping/auto-assign/start \
  -d '{"entities": [...], "relationships": [...], "schema_context": {...}}'

## Step 6: Sync
curl -X POST /dtwin/sync/start \
  -d '{"triplestore_table": "catalog.schema.table", "drop_existing": true}'

## Step 7: Quality checks
curl -X POST /dtwin/quality/start \
  -d '{"triplestore_table": "catalog.schema.table"}'
```

Async endpoints return a `task_id`. Poll `GET /tasks/{task_id}/status` for progress and results.

---

### Programmatic & MCP Access

After your graph viewer is built, it can be queried programmatically:

- **Knowledge Graph API** (`/api/v1/digitaltwin/`): Stateless REST endpoints for triple store status, entity search, ontology retrieval, and more. See [External API](api.md).
- **GraphQL API** (`/graphql/{domain_name}`): Auto-generated typed schema with nested relationship traversal. See [External API](api.md#graphql-api).
- **MCP Server**: Expose your graph viewer to the Databricks Playground and LLM clients. See [MCP Server](mcp.md).

## Ontology import (merged)

## Importing Ontologies

OntoBricks supports multiple ways to create or bootstrap an ontology: from scratch using the visual designer, from OWL/RDFS files, or by importing industry-standard ontologies. This page covers every import method available in the **Ontology > Import** section.

---

### Import Methods at a Glance

| Method | Source | Formats | Use Case |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| **OWL** | Local file or Unity Catalog Volume | `.ttl`, `.owl`, `.rdf`, `.xml` | Load an existing OWL ontology |
| **RDFS** | Local file or Unity Catalog Volume | `.ttl`, `.rdf`, `.xml`, `.rdfs`, `.n3`, `.nt` | Load an RDF Schema |
| **FIBO** | EDM Council spec server | RDF/XML, Turtle | Financial industry ontology |
| **CDISC** | PhUSE GitHub repository | RDF/XML, Turtle | Clinical data standards |
| **IOF** | IOF GitHub repository | RDF/XML | Digital manufacturing ontology |

All imports merge the fetched content, parse it, and store the result in the current domain session. You can continue editing entities, relationships, and attributes after import.

---

### OWL Import

Import an ontology written in the **Web Ontology Language (OWL)**.

#### From a Local File

1. Open **Ontology > Import > OWL**.
2. Click **Choose File** and select an OWL file (`.ttl`, `.owl`, `.rdf`, `.xml`).
3. Click **Import**.
4. OntoBricks parses the file and loads all classes, properties, constraints, SWRL rules, and axioms.

#### From Unity Catalog

1. In the same OWL tab, switch to the **Unity Catalog** sub-tab.
2. Select a **Catalog**, **Schema**, and **Volume** from the dropdown lists.
3. OntoBricks lists the OWL files found in the volume.
4. Select a file and click **Load**.

---

### RDFS Import

Import an **RDF Schema** file. RDFS provides a lighter vocabulary than OWL — class hierarchies and property definitions are supported.

1. Open **Ontology > Import > RDFS**.
2. Choose a local file or a Unity Catalog Volume file (`.ttl`, `.rdf`, `.xml`, `.rdfs`, `.n3`, `.nt`).
3. Click **Import**.

---

### FIBO — Financial Industry Business Ontology

[FIBO](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/) is developed by the **EDM Council** and provides a comprehensive ontology for the financial industry: entities, instruments, products, business processes, and regulatory concepts.

#### Available Domains

| Domain | Key | Required | Description |
|--------|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Foundations** | FND | Yes (auto-included) | Core concepts: parties, agreements, relations, dates, organizations, accounting |
| **Business Entities** | BE | No | Legal entities, corporations, partnerships, government bodies, ownership structures |
| **Financial Business & Commerce** | FBC | No | Financial products, services, intermediaries, markets, instruments |
| **Loans** | LOAN | No | Loan products, applications, mortgages, real estate lending |
| **Securities** | SEC | No | Equities, bonds, debt instruments, investment funds |
| **Derivatives** | DER | No | Options, futures, swaps, commodity and currency contracts |

#### How to Import

1. Open **Ontology > Import > FIBO**.
2. Check the domains you want. **Foundations (FND)** is always included because all other domains depend on it.
3. Click **Import Selected Domains**.
4. OntoBricks fetches the modules from `spec.edmcouncil.org`, merges them with RDFLib, and parses the result.
5. A summary notification shows the number of classes and properties imported.

#### Source

Modules are downloaded from the EDM Council specification server:

```
https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/master/latest/
```

### CDISC — Clinical Data Interchange Standards

[CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/) standards define data models for clinical research. OntoBricks imports the RDF representations published by the [PhUSE](https://github.com/phuse-org/rdf.cdisc.org) working group.

#### Available Standards

| Standard | Key | Required | Description |
|----------|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Schemas** | SCHEMAS | Yes (auto-included) | Meta-Model (ISO 11179), CT Schema, CDISC Schema — the foundational layer |
| **SDTM** | SDTM | No | Study Data Tabulation Model (v1.2, v1.3, IG 3.1.2, IG 3.1.3) |
| **CDASH** | CDASH | No | Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (v1.1) |
| **SEND** | SEND | No | Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (IG 3.0) |
| **ADaM** | ADaM | No | Analysis Data Model (v2.1, IG 1.0) |

#### How to Import

1. Open **Ontology > Import > CDISC**.
2. Check the standards you want. **Schemas** is always included.
3. Click **Import Selected Standards**.
4. OntoBricks fetches the modules from GitHub, merges them, and applies a custom mapper that translates CDISC-specific constructs (DomainContext, Domain, Dataset, DataElement) into OWL classes and properties.

#### Source

Modules are downloaded from the PhUSE GitHub repository:

```
https://github.com/phuse-org/rdf.cdisc.org
```

#### Note on CDISC Mapping

When CDISC standard data (SDTM, CDASH, etc.) is imported, OntoBricks uses a specialized mapper rather than the generic OWL parser:

- **DomainContext** entries become top-level OWL classes.
- **Domain** / **Dataset** entries become OWL classes grouped under their context.
- **DataElement** entries become data properties attached to their parent domain.

This produces a more meaningful ontology structure than a raw RDF parse.

---

### IOF — Industrial Ontologies Foundry

[IOF](https://www.industrialontologies.org/) is developed by **OAGi** and provides ontologies for digital manufacturing. All IOF ontologies are built on **BFO (Basic Formal Ontology)**.

#### Available Domains

| Domain | Key | Required | Description |
|--------|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Core** | CORE | Yes (auto-included) | Common manufacturing concepts: agents, processes, capabilities, organizations, products, business functions |
| **Maintenance** | MAINTENANCE | No | Maintenance management, procedures, asset failure analysis, FMEA |
| **Supply Chain** | SUPPLYCHAIN | No | Procurement, transportation, warehousing, distribution, logistics |

#### How to Import

1. Open **Ontology > Import > IOF**.
2. Check the domains you want. **Core** is always included because all domain ontologies depend on it.
3. Click **Import Selected Domains**.
4. OntoBricks fetches the RDF modules from GitHub, merges them with RDFLib, and parses the result.
5. A post-processing step extracts relationships from OWL restrictions and resolves BFO property labels to human-readable names.

#### Source

Modules are downloaded from the IOF GitHub repository:

```
https://github.com/iofoundry/ontology
```

#### Note on BFO-Based Ontologies

IOF ontologies define most class-to-class relationships through **OWL restrictions** (`owl:someValuesFrom` / `owl:allValuesFrom` inside `rdfs:subClassOf`) rather than explicit `rdfs:domain` / `rdfs:range` on properties. OntoBricks includes a dedicated extraction step that:

1. Scans `rdfs:subClassOf` and `owl:equivalentClass` axioms for restriction patterns.
2. Resolves opaque BFO property URIs (e.g., `BFO_0000057`) to readable labels (e.g., `hasParticipantAtSomeTime`) using graph labels and a built-in dictionary.
3. Filters out relationships whose endpoints reference external BFO classes not present in the import.

This ensures the ontology model displays accurate, readable relationships.

---

### REST API Endpoints

All import operations are also available through the REST API.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/ontology/parse-owl` | Parse OWL content (body: `{"content": "..."}`) |

### Common Import Workflow

Regardless of the method, the import workflow follows the same pattern:

```
Select source & options
        │
        ▼
Fetch modules (concurrently for standards)
        │
        ▼
Merge into a single RDFLib graph
        │
        ▼
Serialize to Turtle
        │
        ▼
Parse with OWL/RDFS parser
        │
        ▼
Post-processing (filtering, restriction extraction, label resolution)
        │
        ▼
Store in domain session
        │
        ▼
UI refreshes (entities, relationships, map)
```

After import you can:

- **Edit** entities, relationships, and attributes in the visual designer or form views.
- **Add** new entities or relationships on top of the imported ontology.
- **Map** entities to Databricks tables in the Mapping section.
- **Export** the combined ontology as OWL/Turtle.

### Tips

- **Start small**: When importing a large standard like FIBO, start with the required foundation module and one domain to evaluate the result before adding more.
- **Network access**: Industry-standard imports require outbound internet access to fetch modules from their public repositories. If running in Databricks Apps with restricted egress, download the files manually and use the OWL file import instead.
- **Incremental import**: Each import replaces the current ontology. If you need to combine multiple standards, export after each import and merge the OWL files externally.
- **Layout reset**: After importing a large ontology, use **Auto-Layout** in the **Ontology Designer** view to arrange entities automatically.
