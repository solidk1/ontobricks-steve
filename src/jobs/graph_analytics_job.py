"""Serverless Lakeflow job computing the iterative graph metrics at scale.

PageRank, connected components, and the clustering coefficient need repeated
passes over the graph. Those run here, as a Databricks job, and land per-node
scores in a Delta table the app reads back with a top-N query.

**Why generated SQL rather than the DataFrame API.** Every algorithm below is
emitted as SQL strings and executed with ``spark.sql``. That keeps one
implementation testable: ``tests/units/core/test_graph_analytics_job_sql.py``
runs the exact same statements against SQLite and checks the results against a
NetworkX oracle. A DataFrame implementation could not be verified without a
live Spark cluster. The generated SQL deliberately sticks to portable
constructs — ``DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`` plus ``CREATE TABLE AS`` instead of
``CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE``, and no engine-specific functions beyond ``least``
/ ``greatest``.

Materialising each iteration into a real table (rather than a temp view) is
also what keeps Spark's query plan from growing without bound across
iterations: the write truncates the lineage. The two iterative algorithms
alternate between an ``_a`` and a ``_b`` table so a step never reads and writes
the same relation.

This module imports ``pyspark`` lazily inside :func:`main` so the SQL builders
stay importable in a plain Python test environment.
