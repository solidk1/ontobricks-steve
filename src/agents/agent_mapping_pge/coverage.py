"""Deterministic coverage enforcement + derived-mapping construction.

The Planner is good at the *how* (which column is the canonical id, which
tables join, in what order to attempt things) but it must NOT be trusted with
the *what*: the set of entities and relationships that need mapping is fixed —
it is exactly the input ontology.  Leaving coverage to the LLM produced
non-deterministic partial runs (some classes silently dropped into
``mapping_plan.skip``) and, because relationships were skipped whenever an
endpoint entity was absent, zero relationship coverage.

This module computes the FULL, dependency-ordered coverage set from the
ontology itself (using the Planner's order only as a hint), and builds the two
kinds of mapping the LLM Generators cannot/should not produce:

* **Abstract-superclass mappings** — a class with subclasses but no source
  table of its own (``Person``, ``Patient``, ``Clinicalencounter``,
  ``Clinicalfinding``).  Its instances are exactly the UNION of its concrete
  leaf subclasses, so we derive it mechanically from the already-validated
  subclass mappings.  Reusing the subclasses' verbatim ``sql_query`` keeps the
  abstract id-universe byte-identical to the union of its parts, which is what
  makes relationships pointing at the abstract (e.g. ``managedby`` with domain
  ``Clinicalencounter``) join with zero dangling.

* **Synthetic endpoint id-universe** — when a relationship endpoint entity has
  no full mapping yet, we synthesise a minimal ``{sql_query, id_column}`` from
  the Planner's ``canonical_ids`` so the relationship can still be attempted
  instead of silently skipped.

All functions here are pure data transforms — no LLM, no I/O — so they are
fast and unit-testable.
