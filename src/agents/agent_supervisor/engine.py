"""Supervisor engine - assess complexity, then dispatch to the right engine.

This is the in-process brain the Agent Bricks Supervisor delegates to. Given a
task ("mapping" or "ontology") plus the domain's metadata and ontology, it runs
the deterministic ``ComplexityAssessor``, picks the engine, and invokes it via
``AgentClient``.

Engine selection (deterministic):

* "mapping" - the genuine two-engine choice. PGE: ``agent_mapping_pge``;
  simple: ``agent_auto_assignment`` (the original single-agent engine from
  ``master``). This is what the complexity score routes between.
* "ontology" - a single engine, ``agent_owl_generator`` (its PGE Evaluator stage
  is bounded internally; there is no separate "simple ontology engine"). The
  complexity report is still produced for observability, but dispatch is
  unconditional.

The mapping selection can be forced via ``engine_override`` for callers that
already know which engine they want (e.g. the supervisor acting on its own
routing decision).
