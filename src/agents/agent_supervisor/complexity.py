"""Deterministic domain-complexity assessment for engine selection.

The supervisor must decide, for a given domain, whether to run the heavyweight
PGE loop (planner → generator → evaluator → critic, multi-attempt, multi-replan)
or the lightweight single-agent engine. That decision is **deterministic** — it
is computed here from the source metadata + the generated ontology, never left
to an LLM's discretion — and then *exposed* to the Agent Bricks Supervisor as a
tool it calls before routing (see ``agent_supervisor/mas.py``).

Why deterministic: a Multi-Agent Supervisor routes semantically over agent
descriptions, which is fine for "which specialist answers this question" but
unreliable for "is this domain complex enough to warrant the expensive engine".
We keep the hard threshold in code, register it as a Unity Catalog function
(``uc_function.sql``), and let the supervisor's natural-language instructions act
on its structured recommendation.

The signals that make a domain *hard to map* — and therefore worth the PGE loop:

* **Many source tables** — more SQL surface to plan and validate.
* **Cross-source reconciliation** — the same real-world entity realised by
  several tables (one per source system / region / tenant) whose keys and column
  names disagree. This is exactly what the PGE planner + semantic critic exist
  for; the simple engine has no notion of it.
* **A large ontology** — many classes / object properties means many mapping
  items, each a chance for a dangling endpoint the evaluator must catch.
* **Schema heterogeneity** — divergent naming conventions across tables (e.g.
  ``MOTHER_NHS_NO`` vs ``mother_nhs_number``) signal multi-source feeds that need
  normalization the PGE engine performs.
