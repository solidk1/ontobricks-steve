"""Graph-DB connection profile for Lakebase (Postgres).

The generic connection machinery — the LIFO pool, JWT rotation, cold-start
retry and the ``psycopg`` import gate — lives in the shared technical layer
:mod:`back.core.databricks.lakebase`, which the registry store and the graph
triple store both build on (they remain two independent databases).

This module is the graph engine's *profile* of that shared layer: it binds
the pool to the ``ontobricks-graphdb`` workload label and the graph error
type, and exposes the ``psycopg`` gate under the name the graph package uses.
It is the single place that says "this is how the graph engine talks to
Lakebase" — the analogue of the registry store's own connection helpers.
