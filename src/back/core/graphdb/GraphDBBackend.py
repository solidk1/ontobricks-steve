"""Abstract base class for graph database backends.

A graph DB backend is a graph-capable triple store (e.g. Lakebase Postgres,
Databricks Delta, or any future Cypher / Gremlin engine plugged in via
``_starter_kit/``) operating on the ``(subject, predicate, object)`` triple
model.  It is the single storage abstraction used across OntoBricks for
querying, reasoning, graph traversal, and analytics.

``GraphDBBackend`` provides:

* the core CRUD abstract methods every backend must implement;
* a large set of named query / reasoning methods with default SQL
  implementations (SQL-based backends inherit these; non-SQL engines such as
  Cypher or Gremlin override with native queries);
* graph-specific concerns — connection management, schema introspection, sync
  to/from remote storage, capability flags, and query-translator selection.
