"""Reusable Lakebase grant primitives.

In-app equivalents of the ``GRANT`` statements in
``scripts/bootstrap-lakebase-perms.sh``, used by:

- :meth:`~back.objects.registry.store.postgres.store.PostgresRegistryStore.grant_app_permissions`
  — the *Initialize* / *Repair permissions* flow (registry schema).
- :func:`resolve_mcp_app_name`, consumed by ``SettingsService`` for MCP
  companion-app name derivation (unrelated to grants, but it lives here
  because it resolves the same app-name inputs).

The *Create graph DB* provisioner that was the other caller is gone; these
control-plane grants are Lakebase-specific and are reworked for Azure in P2
(see ``.planning/databricks-decoupling/SPEC.md``).

Permission model (identical to the bash script):

- The connecting principal must **own** the schema to run the Postgres
  ``GRANT`` statements. The app's service principal owns it because it
  ran ``CREATE SCHEMA`` during *Initialize* / *Create graph DB*.
- ``CAN_USE`` on the Lakebase project and ``ALL_PRIVILEGES`` on the Unity
  Catalog catalog are control-plane grants that need *manage* rights the
  SP may not hold — they are therefore best-effort and downgrade to a
  warning instead of aborting (same tolerance as the bash script).

Every function returns ``(granted, warnings)`` — two lists of
human-readable strings the caller aggregates into its task/route result.
