"""Graph metrics, computed entirely by the Databricks graph analytics job.

This is the *only* analytics compute path. The job reads the ``…_data``
snapshot the Build materialises from the R2RML VIEW, writes four tables, and
this module assembles them into a :class:`MetricsResult`:

* ``<out>``                  one row per scored node, with ``type_uri`` and ``label``
* ``<out>_summary``          node / edge / component counts, pivot and BFS flags
* ``<out>_type_profiles``    per-entity-type counts, degree sum, mean clustering
* ``<out>_type_predicates``  the distinct relationship predicates per type

Nothing here computes a metric. The one piece of logic the app still applies is
the flat-dataset heuristic in :mod:`back.core.graph_analysis.profiles`, which
turns ``(instance_count, distinct_predicates)`` into a human-readable verdict —
string matching on predicate names, not graph computation.

Betweenness and closeness are Brandes-Pich *estimates* sampled from pivots, so
they are flagged as approximate. They drop to unavailable when the pivot BFS was
truncated by its depth cap, since the distance sums would be biased — raise
``analytics_job_max_depth`` and re-run when that happens.

The read-back keeps the bounded-payload contract: only the union of the top-N
per metric is returned, never a row per node.

    all three sqlglot dialects, and would need the ``ROUND`` argument cast to
    ``numeric`` to execute on Postgres.

    The three branches are the two degenerate cases plus the general one:

    * ``hi <= lo`` — every node scores identically (a fully regular graph, or a
      metric the run left all-zero). The general expression would divide by
      zero, so everything collapses into bin 0.
    * ``value >= hi`` — the top-scoring node would otherwise compute ``bins``,
      one index past the last bucket.
    * otherwise, scale into ``[0, bins)`` via ``CAST(ROUND(..., 10) AS INTEGER)``.
      Every metric is non-negative by construction, which is what makes integer
      truncation equivalent to ``floor`` and saves needing a ``floor`` function.

    The ``ROUND(..., 10)`` is load-bearing. A value sitting exactly on a bin
    boundary is common — any metric quantised to a few distinct values, which
    ``clustering`` and ``degree`` routinely are — and binary64 puts the scaled
    result a few parts in 10^16 below the integer it should equal, so bare
    truncation drops it into the bin below. Rounding at the tenth decimal
