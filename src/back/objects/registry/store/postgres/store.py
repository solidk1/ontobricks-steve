"""Postgres-on-Lakebase implementation of :class:`RegistryStore`.

Storage layout (one Postgres schema, default ``ontobricks_registry``):

- ``registries``        — one row per OntoBricks instance
- ``global_config``     — single-row JSONB blob (warehouse_id, …)
- ``domains``           — one row per domain folder
- ``domain_versions``   — one row per domain version, full document split
                          into JSONB columns + a few hot scalar fields
- ``domain_permissions``— Viewer/Editor/Builder per principal/domain
- ``schedules``         — one row per scheduled domain
- ``schedule_runs``     — append-only, capped per domain
- ``build_runs``        — append-only build-run trace, one row per
                          Knowledge Graph build (all paths), keyed by
                          ``(domain_id, version)``

Authentication:
- Connection params (host/port/db/user) come from ``PG*`` env vars
  injected by the Apps ``postgres`` resource binding (Lakebase
  Autoscaling — the only tier supported by OntoBricks).
- The Postgres password is a short-lived OAuth token minted by
  :class:`back.core.databricks.lakebase.LakebaseAuth`.

Cold start:
- Lakebase Autoscaling scales-to-zero when idle. Initial calls
  retry with exponential backoff on SQLSTATE ``57P03``
  ("cannot_connect_now") and on ``connection refused``.

Connection pooling:
- The connection machinery is shared with the graph triple store and
  lives in :mod:`back.core.databricks.lakebase`. A process-wide LIFO
  pool keeps a small handful of warm psycopg connections, keyed by the
  full connection identity (host/port/db/user/instance/schema) plus the
  ``ontobricks-registry`` workload label. This avoids the 200-500 ms
  TCP+TLS+JWT handshake per call and turns hot-path operations like
  *Load Domain from Registry* into a single network round-trip per
  query. Connections are recycled before the 1 h JWT expiry so token
  rotation stays invisible to callers. The registry and the graph store
  remain independent databases — they never share a pool.

Token expiry:
- Authentication failures (SQLSTATE ``28P01``) trigger a single
  invalidate-and-retry cycle when *opening* a fresh connection. Pooled
  connections that hit auth failure mid-flight are discarded by the
  ``_connect`` context manager.

The whole module is import-safe even without ``psycopg`` installed —
it raises a clear error only when the class is instantiated.
