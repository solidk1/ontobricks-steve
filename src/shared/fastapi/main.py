# OntoBricks API

**Graph Viewer Builder for Databricks**

OntoBricks enables you to build knowledge graphs from Databricks tables using ontologies 
and R2RML mappings. Design an ontology, map it to your data, and materialize triples 
into a Delta triple store for visual exploration and quality validation.

## Features

- 🏗️ **Ontology Design** - Visual ontology editor with OWL export
- 🔗 **Data Mapping** - Map ontology concepts to Databricks tables
- 🔍 **SPARQL Queries** - Query data using W3C standard SPARQL
- 📊 **Knowledge Graph Graph Viewer** - Interactive sigma.js WebGL graph exploration with SPARQL-based quality checks
- 📦 **Domain Management** - Save/load domains to Unity Catalog volumes
- 🔮 **GraphQL API** - Auto-generated typed schema from ontology with nested entity traversal

## Quick Start

1. Configure Databricks connection in **Settings**
2. Create or import an **Ontology**
3. **Map** ontology entities to your tables
4. Execute **SPARQL queries**

## External API

Programmatic REST endpoints live under `/api/v1/*`. **Swagger UI:** [`/api/docs`](/api/docs) · **OpenAPI JSON:** [`/api/openapi.json`](/api/openapi.json)

This page documents the **application** surface (UI JSON routes, GraphQL, settings). It is separate from the external contract.

    over HTTP. One App is cheaper and removes the cross-app hop.

    same). And its routes are merged rather than mounted, mirroring upstream's own
