"""FastAPI dependencies for declarative permission gates.

The middleware (:mod:`shared.fastapi.main`) resolves the caller's app
and domain roles and stores them on ``request.state``. These guards
turn that into per-route declarative checks::

    @router.post(
        "/teams",
        dependencies=[Depends(require(ROLE_ADMIN))],
    )
    async def teams_save_batch(...): ...

Two scopes are supported:

* ``scope="app"`` (default) reads ``request.state.user_role`` -- the
  Databricks-App-level role (``admin`` / ``app_user`` / ``none``).
* ``scope="domain"`` reads ``request.state.user_domain_role`` and
  falls back to ``user_role`` so admins (who bypass the domain gate)
  still pass.

Below-min callers raise :class:`back.core.errors.AuthorizationError`
which surfaces as a structured 403 via the global exception handler.

Lives under ``api/routers/internal/`` (not ``back/objects/registry/``)
because it is pure FastAPI route glue -- the only thing importing
``fastapi.Request`` in this call chain -- matching the sibling
``_permissions.py`` module in the same package.
